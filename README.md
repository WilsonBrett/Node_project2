# GA-WDI node_project2

This project was created while I was in the General Assembly web development immersion program in early 2016.  It was built in node.js and works with a mjor newspapers movie reviews api to retrive a ist of movies via Ajax and other serverside calls to get detailed info back for the user.  Other technologies include mongolab, JSON, express, mongoose ORM, and jquery.
